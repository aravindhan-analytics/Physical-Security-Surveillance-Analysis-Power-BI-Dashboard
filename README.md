# Physical-Security-Surveillance-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
End-to-end security surveillance analysis using PostgreSQL and Power BI. Includes data modeling, DAX calculations, KPI tracking, drill-through navigation, decomposition tree analysis, and location-based incident monitoring dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes physical security surveillance data including camera status, security incidents, locations, and event logs.

The objective is to monitor camera performance, identify incident trends, and provide actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

This project simulates a real-world enterprise physical security monitoring system.
